1. Discuss what needs to happen when inserting a new row into the check-ins table.

	a. The system will check what what equipment are available to use and 
	   choose one to put in the spot that has "sanitized" in the condition
	   field.  Thus making a trigger select it in the database, making it
	   turn from "sanitized" to "inUse".

	b. The database will choice one of the available(sanitized) equipment 
	   and by use of triggers make the equipment change from "sanitized" to
	   "inUse"
		
		I. I currently do not know how I would have the database do this.

2. Make a trigger that when the equipment has been checked back in and the "timeIn"
   field is not equal to NULL, then change the condition of the equipment to 
   "needsSanitized".
