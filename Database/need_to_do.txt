1. The system will check what what equipment are available to use and 
   choose one to put in the spot that has "sanitized" in the condition
   field.  Thus making a trigger select it in the database, making it
   turn from "sanitized" to "inUse".

2. Make a trigger that when the equipment has been checked back in and the "timeIn"
   field is not equal to NULL, then change the condition of the equipment to 
   "needsSanitized".
