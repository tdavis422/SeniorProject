# SeniorProject
This is for my group's Senior Project for the Southwest Baptist University's Game Room. 
This is to help the student workers with getting the log filled out to see what is being used in the game room the most.
Our Project Champion is Dr. Nathan Penland, Director of the Student Association at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO.
